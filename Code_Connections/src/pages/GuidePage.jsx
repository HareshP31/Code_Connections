          <p>A hackathon is an event where you can work alone or on a team to create something (consider finding a team on Code Connections!). Despite having "hack" in the name, it does not have to do with hacking! At hackathons, people create anything,
          from games to hardware projects. Hackathons are usually time-limited, often lasting 24 
          to 48 hours, where participants brainstorm ideas, develop prototypes, and showcase their projects. Theyâ€™re a great way to learn new skills, 
          collaborate with others, and bring creative ideas to life. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, 
          hackathons provide a supportive environment to experiment,
          build something cool, and have fun! Plus, many hackathons offer mentorship, workshops, and prizes to help teams succeed. Hackathons are 
          valuable opportunities to get real world skills and impress potential employers with knowledge from outside the classroom.

        <div className="hackathon-section">
        <p>At a hackathon, you can expect a fast-paced, collaborative, and exciting environment filled with people eager to build and learn. 
            There will be an opening ceremony where organizers introduce the theme (if there is one), go over rules, 
            and share important logistics. After that, teams form (if you donâ€™t have one already) 
            and start brainstorming ideas before diving into coding and development. Throughout the event,
             there will likely be workshops, mentor sessions, and mini-challenges to help you improve your skills and refine your project. 
             Expect a mix of focused work sessions, networking opportunities, and social activities to keep the energy up. 
             Many hackathons provide food, drinks, and even fun breaks like games or midnight snacks. 
             At the end, teams present their projects to a panel of judges, who give feedback and award prizes.

        <div className="hackathon-section">
        <p>If all of that sounds overwhelming, donâ€™t worry! Hackathons are meant to be fun and welcoming, no matter your skill level. 
          You donâ€™t need to be an expert programmer or have a perfect idea before you start. Many participants are beginners, 
          and there will be mentors, workshops, and teammates to help you along the way. The goal isnâ€™t just to win, itâ€™s to learn, 
          try something new, and enjoy the experience. You can go at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and focus on what interests 
          you most. Everyone is there to support each other, and the best projects often come from just experimenting and having fun. 
          No matter what, youâ€™ll walk away with new skills, new friends, and a cool experience to remember!
