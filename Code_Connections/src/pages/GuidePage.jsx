        <p>A hackathon is an event where you can work alone or on a team to create something (consider finding a team on Code Connections!). Despite having "hack" in the name, it does not have to do with hacking! At hackathons, people create anything,
        from games to hardware projects. Hackathons are usually time-limited, often lasting 24 
        to 48 hours, where participants brainstorm ideas, develop prototypes, and showcase their projects. Theyâ€™re a great way to learn new skills, 
        collaborate with others, and bring creative ideas to life. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, 
        hackathons provide a supportive environment to experiment,
        build something cool, and have fun! Plus, many hackathons offer mentorship, workshops, and prizes to help teams succeed.

        <div className="hackathon-section">
        <p>At a hackathon, you can expect a fast-paced, collaborative, and exciting environment filled with people eager to build and learn. 
            There will be an opening ceremony where organizers introduce the theme (if there is one), go over rules, 
            and share important logistics. After that, teams form (if you donâ€™t have one already) 
            and start brainstorming ideas before diving into coding and development. Throughout the event,
             there will likely be workshops, mentor sessions, and mini-challenges to help you improve your skills and refine your project. 
             Expect a mix of focused work sessions, networking opportunities, and social activities to keep the energy up. 
             Many hackathons provide food, drinks, and even fun breaks like games or midnight snacks. 
             At the end, teams present their projects to a panel of judges, who give feedback and award prizes.
